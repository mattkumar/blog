It uses reactable and scss in Quarto to style a Jeopardy! game board. \nMy aims for this project were three-fold:\n  To think about creative uses of tables! ✅\n  Learn how to use some of reactable’s custom rendering capabilities ✅\n  Continue to investigate and experiment (s)css and Quarto. ✅\n  Approach I start by pulling archived Jeopardy! game data using the whatr 📦. What’s nice is that each row of data is indexed by the row and column it appears on in the actual board 😝. This makes it simple to ensure the right content is in the right place. ✅\nIn the next step, I borrow some preexisting css for creating flip cards 🔍. I ♻️, 🔨 and 🗑 elements in order to match the aesthetic of Jeopardy! This was relatively straightforward, though researching colors and fonts took a bit of time.\nThe last step is to arrange the data once it’s been read into R into a format serviceable for display. I knew I planned to use reactable as the display table package and leverage escaping html.\nMethod 1 My first approach was to bake the html/css stuff directly into each cell, before passing it to reactable for escaping. It looked something like this:\nraw_data %\u0026gt;%\r.... %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(content = if_else(row == 1,\r# html for header\rglue::glue(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;flip-card\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;flip-card-inner\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;flip-card-head\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;{category}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;flip-card-head\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r{category}\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026#39;)\r.... %\u0026gt;%\rreactable(.,\rdefaultColDef = colDef(html = TRUE))\r While this certainly worked (it has in the past for me), I knew reactable had more to offer in terms of custom rendering but have never delved into it.😨\nMethod 2 It turns reactables defaultColDef argument works great for custom rendering in this case since every cell in my Jeopardy! board needs the same html/css treatment. It looks something like this:\ntable_data %\u0026gt;%\rreactable(.,\rsortable = FALSE,\rdefaultColDef = colDef(\rhtml = TRUE,\ralign = \u0026#34;center\u0026#34;,\rheader = function(value) {\rtags$div(\rclass = \u0026#34;flip-card flip-card-head\u0026#34;,\rvalue\r)\r})\r)\r I like this approach much better than the first because I’m keeping table and data wrangling parts of my workflow separate and hopefully more clear for readers. 🤓\nForward It’s been an awesome ride so far experimenting with Quarto and continuing to learn how to create and modify existing CSS. I’m happy that the R Studio 2022 Table Contest. is taking place right around this time because it was a constructive outlet to build something that uses the new things I’ve recently learned.\n🍻✌ Enjoy!\n","date":1664323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664323200,"objectID":"bf4a9b36827480f70a52133fb3da64c4","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/project/jeopardy/","publishdate":"2022-09-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/jeopardy/","section":"project","summary":"Recreating a Jeopardy! game board using reactable and css in Quarto","tags":["reactable","quarto","table"],"title":"Jeopardy!","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview\rThis app is an initial exploration into shiny for Python which was revealed at rstudio::conf(2022) earlier this summer.🐍🐍🐍 Aim\nThe aim of the exploration was to try out the API and see whether I can recreate common patterns/functionalities I use in my other apps.

My thesis advisor recommended I look into R as he had caught wind of a package that could help. The upside was that it would be 🆓 and open source 🤑. The downside was that I was going to have to learn “syntax” 🤢. I was aware that SPSS had syntax facilities for advanced users, but it was always intimidating 😣.\nBut now I had to learn “syntax”.

For example, cell B4 has the value of: http://www.amazon.ca/. This is what I need access to.\nI figured one of the existing R packages that could extract this information. I checked the usual: readxl, xlsx, and openxlsx and was surprised that none could.\nMy next thought was to just have the URLs extracted in Excel, prior to reading them into R.

Extract the hyperlink target\r# 2. Otherwise just keep the original value as a string\rfor row_cells in ws.iter_rows():\rfor cell in row_cells:\rtry:\rcell.value = cell.hyperlink.target\rexcept:\rcell.value = str(cell.value)\r# Store values to a data frame, clean up headers tmp = pd.DataFrame(ws.values)\rtmp.rename(columns = tmp.iloc[0], inplace = True)\rtmp.drop(tmp.index[0], inplace = True)\rreturn tmp\r At this point, what’s left is integrating the python script into an existing R workflow so that I can actually use it.\nlibrary(reticulate)\r# Load python function\rsource_python(\u0026#34;get_hyperlink.py\u0026#34;)\r# Use python function\rmy_data \u0026lt;- get_hyperlink(path = \u0026#34;input.xlsx\u0026#34;, sheet = \u0026#34;Sheet1\u0026#34;)\r The results:\nhead(my_data)\r ## ID source1\r## 1 1 http://www.gmail.com/\r## 2 2 http://www.eventhubs.com/\r## 3 3 http://www.rstudio.com/\r## 4 4 http://www.amazon.ca/\r## 5 5 None\r And that’s a wrap! ✅🏁🍻\nActually, there’s one other feature of the reticulate package I want to share.

Throughout my career, I’ve served many different roles, from statistician to programmer to epidemiologist to most recently, computational scientist. Over the last bit, I’ve kind of lost touch with my mathematical and statistical roots. Every so often, I will dive back into some concepts to remind myself how it works and learn of any new developments.\nBayesian statistics was an interesting course in my graduate program. Unfortunately, I haven’t used it as much as I would have wished, but I am simply fascinated by the math. At the same time, it can be challenging to wrap your head around what’s going on underneath the hood in the estimation process. This is precisely why I made this post.\n I’ll stop here to direct you towards the original (more comprehensive) post I made concerning this topic, which can be found here\n In short, this project involved a few key activities that helped refresh my memory and deepen my understanding, all through using R, animation and simulation.\n  Simulating data arising from a statistical model with known parameters. Logistic regression was the use case.\n  Fitting the model on simulated data to recover the known parameters, verifying the simulation worked.\n  Building an MCMC sampler (Random Walks Metropolis-Hastings) in order to fit a Bayesian version of the logistic regression model\n  Understand exactly what the algorithm does at each step and visualize this via animation. Understand the impact of different priors, candidate distributions, and jump steps in the algorithm.\n  Compare results obtained through the MCMC sampler against what we previously obtained.\n  To this end, I prepared three visualizations I’d like to share.\n\r\r\rThis visualization shows the first 100 iterations of a single chain in estimating the parameters of the Bayesian logistic regression analysis. I’ve overlaid a table that shows the current and previous values, and the decision taken by the algorithim.\n\r\r\rThis visualization shows the full 10,000 iterations of the single chain. I’ve removed the table of estimates. Here it’s quite clear that the chain quickly settles into the area of the known parameter estimates.\n\r\r\rThe last visualization mixes things up a bit, by providing 4 chains, each with different starting or initialization values. In the end, they all converge.

At the same time, I was also looking to extend my Rmarkdown knowledge to create automated workflows or “pipelines”. You can see where this is going right?\nMy aim was pretty clear: I wanted to create an Rmarkdown-based reporting engine, capable of automatically creating safety narratives for all participants in a clinical trial based on a single template.\nFor this example, I borrowed the clinical trial data from the PHUSE Github Repository, openly available here\nNext, I got to work in seeing what data elements I would want to pick out for my narratives. I was less concerned with what’s actually in a narrative and more interested in the process of automating their creation. Nevertheless, I picked some elements that I think are relevant such as:\n Patient Age/Sex/Race Dates of first and last treatment Adverse Events, including reported term, severity, outcome and associated dates  The technical part of this project was interesting to think about and research. I ultimately decided with the following approach:\n Create a template or skeleton structure of a narrative that will be applied to each patients data The template includes data wrangling steps that will be repeated for each subject. In here, I also include a table object just to test out variety. Using Rmarkdown’s parameters (here each subject’s unique identifier), loop through the unique identifier list and have the corresponding report created.  This was great and I was able to get it to work almost immediately.\nHowever…\nI wanted extend the current approach by providing a user interface to the engine. This is especially useful for non-programming colleagues (or colleagues not familiar with R or Rmarkdown). Enter Shiny.\nBriefly, the user experience can be described as:\n A list of patient identifiers are populated in a DataTable, and the user is instructed to select all or some of the patients they wish to generate a report for. The user then has the option to select the format of their narratives: .docx, .html, or .pdf Once selections are made, from here the process works similar to the above, but within the Shiny server context. The last step involves collecting all generated reports, bundling them into a single zip file, and returning them to the user as a download. While this process happens in real time, a progress bar is provided to the user as feedback.  That last part still amazes me.\nI’ve since taken this a few steps further, investigating even more approaches (e.g. parent-child reports) and conditional execution of narrative text based on values of users data and including graphics.

These usually came in the form of logistic regression (odds ratios) or Cox models (hazard ratios) and needed to be visualized, often using a forest plot.\nWhile that role (and organization) was very SAS-centric, no macro or PROC, to my knowledge, existed at the time that made this process painless. Often analysts would turn to Excel (cringe) and spend needless hours trying to format shoehorn their results into a template.\nTo help overcome this, I created a forest plot in R and shared it with colleagues. As more and more wished to use it and adapt it, I realized this was a good candidate for a Shiny app. So, regardless of familiarity with R, all project members could craft a high-quality, publication ready forest plot for the journal article submission.\nTo help bridge the gap between SAS and R, I structured the input data set required by the shiny app around what PROC logistic or Lifetest would spit out via ODS (or something very near). This was also because at the time, most statistical analyses were not done in R.\nSo, the app works like this.\n I provide you a template with some light conventions to follow. These mimic most SAS PROCS ODS outputs. Fill in the template and upload it to the app. I provide you a good deal of aesthetic control (color, log-scaling, custom breaks, text, etc) to customize your plot.

Many of which are absent here.\nI’ve included this entry here as it served as a major milestone for personal development. It even made the Top 40 New Package Picks shortly after it was released.\nI leave you with the vignettes to see what this package is all about. To give some context, in a previous role funnel plots were a staple of most statistical analyses involving our population-level data holdings.\n The funnelR package provides a flexible framework for creating funnel plots for proportion data. A funnel plot is a powerful visualization in the analysis of unit level performance relative to some criterion. It readily allows identification of units that are In Control or Extreme according to a benchmark at a specified level of confidence (e.g.95%).\n  Framed this way, a funnel plot can be applied to any number of fields of study to monitor and identify units that deviate from what is considered typical. For example, it could be used to differentiate schools that are high, average or low performing on a standardized test according to a National or State benchmark. From a quality improvement point of view, they might help identify which hospitals have extreme mortality or surgical complication rates relative to a benchmark prescribed by a government body.\n  The funnelR package provides many options to specify elements of a funnel plot including user defined: control limits, benchmarks, and estimation methods. It also has the capability to write scored results (i.e. a variable that records whether a unit is In Control or Extreme according to the specifications of the funnel plot) to your sample data set. This variable might then be included in further analysis such as cross-tabulations (e.g. stratification) or regression modeling (e.g. covariate).\n  While many flavors of funnel plots exist (rates, ratios, etc.), the current package considers funnel plots assuming proportion data that is binomially distributed. The interested reader is referred to Spiegelhalter (2005) for further details.\n If you’re interested in a specific use case (the one highlighted in the banner), I got you covered\nIf you want to see more flavors, I turn you to the FunnelPlotR package which is more comprehensive in types of analyses covered and actively maintained.\n","date":1520985600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520985600,"objectID":"e870861441e1238ec105d1acf0780972","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/project/funnelr/","publishdate":"2018-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/funnelr/","section":"project","summary":"Create funnel plots for proportion data using ggplot2.","tags":["Data Visualization","Statistical"],"title":"funnelR","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mozessohn L","Earle C","Spaner D","Cheng SY","Matthew Kumar","Buckstein R"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477008000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477008000,"objectID":"f11239158fa05beb900b4ccf706ef518","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/cll/","publishdate":"2016-10-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cll/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The association of dyslipidemia with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia - a population-based study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Govindarajan A","Urbach D","Matthew Kumar","Li Q","Murray BJ","Juurlink D","Kennedy E","Gagliardi A","Sutradhar R","Baxter NN"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1440115200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1440115200,"objectID":"6647723859dbe11ed8b5310486acaa15","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/nighttime-outcomes/","publishdate":"2015-08-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nighttime-outcomes/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Outcomes of Daytime Procedures Performed by Attending Surgeons after Night Work","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vahabi M","Lofters A","Matthew Kumar","Glazier RH"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1436054400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1436054400,"objectID":"e30197f68c14896cf768f46e4990915a","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/breast_immigrant/","publishdate":"2015-07-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/breast_immigrant/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Breast cancer screening disparities among immigrant women by world region of origin - a population-based study in Ontario, Canada","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vahabi M","Lofters A","Matthew Kumar","Glazier RH"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1435708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1435708800,"objectID":"950990cc06749c14f388e0fe006ff6b9","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/breast_urban/","publishdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/breast_urban/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Breast cancer screening disparities among urban immigrants - a population-based study in Ontario, Canada","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
