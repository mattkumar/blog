If you\u0026#39;re interested in the recording, it can be viewed here. Among presenters were Mike Stackhouse and Eli Miller from Atorus demonstrating a new feature coming to {Tplyr}: the ability to to query and retrieve individual observations from a summary table using a metadata-driven approach.\rImagine a generic table. Imagine clicking on a particular cell of that table. Imagine being able to easily identify patients that comprise that cell. Let that sink in for a second as I did. Pretty powerful stuff...\rAn Example\rExcited to give it a try, I spent the weekend coding up this example. It uses a demographics table as an anchor. Once a cell is selected, a variety of TLFs are linked for the patients in that cell.\r\r\rHere is the anchor TLF. I\u0026#39;ve clicked on the overall total cell for patients categorized as being  80 years of age. There are N = 77 such patients.    Here is the first linked TLF. A simple listing of the N = 77 patients. In Tplyr, you can specify any additional columns you wish to have too.\n   I mentioned figures! Here is a safety figure and an efficacy figure for those N = 77 patients. Each of these figures are also interactive thanks to {highcharter}.\n   Lastly, here is a TLF from a completely separate section (i.e. safety) for those N = 77 patients. I’ve leveraged some of the neat features of {reactable} to nest things.\n   Forward\rNow take this impulse and multiply it by an entire catalog of TLFs and add to it Shiny\u0026#39;s capabilities - what have you got? \r\rA Swiss army knife of productivity capable of serving many functions.

Let me explain.\nMy educational background and training was in Biostatistics. Throughout my career, I’ve served many different roles, from statistician to programmer to epidemiologist to most recently, computational scientist. Over the last bit, I’ve kind of lost touch with my mathematical and statistical roots. Every so often, I will dive back into it to remind myself how it works and to a somewhat lesser extent, keep abreast of new developments.\nBayesian statistics was an interesting course in my graduate program. Unfortunately, I haven’t used it as much as I would have wished, but I am simply fascinated by the math. At the same time, it can be challenging to wrap your head around what’s going on underneath the hood in the estimation process. This is precisely why I made this post.\n I’ll stop here to direct you towards the original (more comprehensive) post I made concerning this topic, which can be found here\n In short, this project involved a few key activities that helped refresh my memory and deepen my understanding, all through using R, animation and visualization.\n  Simulating data arising from a statistical model with known parameters. Logistic regression was the use case.\n  Fitting the model on simulated data to recover the known parameters, verifying the simulation worked.\n  Building an MCMC sampler (Random Walks Metropolis-Hastings) in order to fit a Bayesian-flavored version of the logistic regression model\n  Understand exactly what the algorithm does at each step and visualize this via animation. Understand the impact of different priors, candidate distributions, and jump steps in the algorithm.\n  Compare results obtained through the MCMC sampler against what we previously obtained.\n  To this end, I prepared three visualizations I’d like to share.\n   This visualization shows the first 100 iterations of a single chain in estimating the parameters of the Bayesian logistic regression analysis. I’ve overlaid a table that shows the current and previous values, and the decision taken by the algorithim.\n   This visualization shows the full 10,000 iterations of the single chain. I’ve removed the table of estimates. Here it’s quite clear that the chain quickly settles into the area of the known parameter estimates.\n   The last visualization mixes things up a bit, by providing 4 chains, each with different starting or initialization values. In the end, they all converge. Kind of.\nHope you find it useful!\n","date":1636848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636848000,"objectID":"e00a75198bc3ea4a399946d1923ef5e5","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/project/mcmc/","publishdate":"2021-11-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mcmc/","section":"project","summary":"Unpacking a bunch of related statistical concepts through visualization","tags":["Data Visualization","Statistical","Simulation","Animation"],"title":"Visual MCMC","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This was a neat experiment using the {gganimate} package for storytelling purposes.

At the same time, I was also looking to extend my Rmarkdown knowledge to create automated workflows or “pipelines”. You can see where this is going right?\nMy aim was pretty clear: I wanted to create an Rmarkdown-based reporting engine, capable of automatically creating safety narratives for all participants in a clinical trial based on a single template.\nFor this example, I borrowed the clinical trial data from the PHUSE Github Repository, openly available here\nNext, I got to work in seeing what data elements I would want to pick out for my narratives. I was less concerned with what’s actually in a narrative and more interested in the process of automating their creation. Nevertheless, I picked some elements that I think are relevant such as:\n Patient Age/Sex/Race Dates of first and last treatment Adverse Events, including reported term, severity, outcome and associated dates  The technical part of this project was interesting to think about and research. I ultimately decided with the following approach:\n Create a template or skeleton structure of a narrative that will be applied to each patients data The template includes data wrangling steps that will be repeated for each subject. In here, I also include a table object just to test out variety. Using Rmarkdown’s parameters (here each subject’s unique identifier), loop through the unique identifier list and have the corresponding report created.  This was great and I was able to get it to work almost immediately.\nHowever…\nI wanted extend the current approach by providing a user interface to the engine. This is especially useful for non-programming colleagues (or colleagues not familiar with R or Rmarkdown). Enter Shiny.\nBriefly, the user experience can be described as:\n A list of patient identifiers are populated in a DataTable, and the user is instructed to select all or some of the patients they wish to generate a report for. The user then has the option to select the format of their narratives: .docx, .html, or .pdf Once selections are made, from here the process works similar to the above, but within the Shiny server context. The last step involves collecting all generated reports, bundling them into a single zip file, and returning them to the user as a download. While this process happens in real time, a progress bar is provided to the user as feedback.  That last part still amazes me.\nI’ve since taken this a few steps further, investigating even more approaches (e.g. parent-child reports) and conditional execution of narrative text based on values of users data and including graphics. I will likely update this repo to include those enhancements, but for now enjoy as is!\n","date":1614384000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614384000,"objectID":"b16ca520b392a187a28c39451c6781ec","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/project/rmarkdown-reporting-engine/","publishdate":"2021-02-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rmarkdown-reporting-engine/","section":"project","summary":"Rmarkdown reporting engine for automating patient safety narratives in a clinical trial.","tags":["Shiny","Rmarkdown","Reporting","Automation","Pharma","CDISC","PHUSE"],"title":"Auto-Narratives","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The following project was a second entry into the first R Studio table contest held in 2020.\nI don’t even know where to start with this one.

These usually came in the form of logistic regression (odds ratios) or Cox models (hazard ratios) and needed to be visualized, often using a forest plot.\nWhile that role (and organization) was very SAS-centric, no macro or PROC, to my knowledge, existed at the time that made this process painless. Often analysts would turn to Excel (cringe) and spend needless hours trying to format shoehorn their results into a template.\nTo help overcome this, I created a forest plot in R and shared it with colleagues. As more and more wished to use it and adapt it, I realized this was a good candidate for a Shiny app. So, regardless of familiarity with R, all project members could craft a high-quality, publication ready forest plot for the journal article submission.\nTo help bridge the gap between SAS and R, I structured the input data set required by the shiny app around what PROC logistic or Lifetest would spit out via ODS (or something very near). This was also because at the time, most statistical analyses were not done in R.\nSo, the app works like this.\n I provide you a template with some light conventions to follow. These mimic most SAS PROCS ODS outputs. Fill in the template and upload it to the app. I provide you a good deal of aesthetic control (color, log-scaling, custom breaks, text, etc) to customize your plot.

Many of which are absent here.\nI’ve included this entry here as it served as a major milestone for personal development.\nI leave you with the vignettes to see what this package is all about. To give some context, in a previous role, and similar to forest plots, funnel plots were a staple of most statistical analyses involving our population-level data holdings.\n The funnelR package provides a flexible framework for creating funnel plots for proportion data. A funnel plot is a powerful visualization in the analysis of unit level performance relative to some criterion. It readily allows identification of units that are In Control or Extreme according to a benchmark at a specified level of confidence (e.g.95%).\n  Framed this way, a funnel plot can be applied to any number of fields of study to monitor and identify units that deviate from what is considered typical. For example, it could be used to differentiate schools that are high, average or low performing on a standardized test according to a National or State benchmark. From a quality improvement point of view, they might help identify which hospitals have extreme mortality or surgical complication rates relative to a benchmark prescribed by a government body.\n  The funnelR package provides many options to specify elements of a funnel plot including user defined: control limits, benchmarks, and estimation methods. It also has the capability to write scored results (i.e. a variable that records whether a unit is In Control or Extreme according to the specifications of the funnel plot) to your sample data set. This variable might then be included in further analysis such as cross-tabulations (e.g. stratification) or regression modeling (e.g. covariate).\n  While many flavors of funnel plots exist (rates, ratios, etc.), the current package considers funnel plots assuming proportion data that is binomially distributed. The interested reader is referred to Spiegelhalter (2005) for further details.\n If you’re interested in a specific use case (the one highlighted in the banner), I got you covered\nIf you want to see more flavors, I turn you to the FunnelPlotR package which is more comprehensive in types of analyses covered and actively maintained.\n","date":1520985600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520985600,"objectID":"e870861441e1238ec105d1acf0780972","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/project/funnelr/","publishdate":"2018-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/funnelr/","section":"project","summary":"Create funnel plots for proportion data using ggplot2.","tags":["Data Visualization","Statistical"],"title":"funnelR","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mozessohn L","Earle C","Spaner D","Cheng SY","Matthew Kumar","Buckstein R"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477008000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477008000,"objectID":"f11239158fa05beb900b4ccf706ef518","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/cll/","publishdate":"2016-10-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cll/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The association of dyslipidemia with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia - a population-based study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Govindarajan A","Urbach D","Matthew Kumar","Li Q","Murray BJ","Juurlink D","Kennedy E","Gagliardi A","Sutradhar R","Baxter NN"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1440115200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1440115200,"objectID":"6647723859dbe11ed8b5310486acaa15","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/nighttime-outcomes/","publishdate":"2015-08-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nighttime-outcomes/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Outcomes of Daytime Procedures Performed by Attending Surgeons after Night Work","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vahabi M","Lofters A","Matthew Kumar","Glazier RH"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1436054400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1436054400,"objectID":"e30197f68c14896cf768f46e4990915a","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/breast_immigrant/","publishdate":"2015-07-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/breast_immigrant/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Breast cancer screening disparities among immigrant women by world region of origin - a population-based study in Ontario, Canada","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vahabi M","Lofters A","Matthew Kumar","Glazier RH"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1435708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1435708800,"objectID":"950990cc06749c14f388e0fe006ff6b9","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/breast_urban/","publishdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/breast_urban/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Breast cancer screening disparities among urban immigrants - a population-based study in Ontario, Canada","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
