The idea of 'Visual Abstracts' have recently become popular and are particularly efficient in distilling the main findings of original research.

I wanted to create an application that enabled users (or non programmers in general) to create nice visual summaries for their research projects they could share over social media. I've added a fair bit of control and customization in the application mostly related to layout and aesthetics.

This project was entered into the first ever (2019) Shiny Competition hosted by R Studio and received an honorable mention. You can view the original blog entry [here.](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/first-shiny-contest-winners/)

I also ended up turning this app into a package, which can be installed locally on your machine from [CRAN.](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/abstractr/index.html)

>`install.packages("abstractr")`
