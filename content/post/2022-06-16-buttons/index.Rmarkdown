The default behavior in `shiny::actionButton()` is to open a web link in the *current* window. This approach has two potential implications for user-experience:

1. The current progress within the shiny app will be lost; clicking 🔙 on your browser will reload the app 😭
2. This can (independent of #1) inadvertently divert users away from your app 🏃️💨

⬇️⬇️⬇️ See for yourself ⬇️⬇️⬇️

```{r, echo = F}
shiny::actionButton('btn0','Click Me!', class = "btn-warning", onclick='alert("Just kidding! Youre not going anywhere!")')
```                    
 
So what can we do?

✖️ Do nothing. Leave it as is and let all the hard work you put into the app be overshadowed by the site your are linking to.

✔️ Make the link open in a new tab or window.

✔️ Force the link to open in a new window.

The distinction between the two latter choices boils down to a users default browser settings. If you use Chrome like me, opening a link (designed to open in a tab or new window) defaults to opening it in a new tab. In other instances, it *might* open in a new window. Who knows? 🎱 

If you really need the link to open in a separate window, luckily with a little elbow grease we can make that a sure thing.🎯

Below, I have three buttons and their corresponding code you might use in a shiny app. It's pretty straight forward so I'll end here. ✌🍻

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
# Default - current
shiny::actionButton('btn1',
                    'Current',
                    onclick ="location.href='http://google.com';")

# New tab or window  
shiny::actionButton('btn2',
                    'New Window or Tab', 
                    onclick ="window.open('http://google.com', '_blank')")

# New window
shiny::actionButton('btn3',
                    'New Window', 
                    onclick ="window.open('http://google.com', '_blank','width=800,height=800')")
```

```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
shiny::actionButton('btn1',
                    'Current Window',
                    class = "btn-danger",
                    onclick ="location.href='http://google.com';")
shiny::HTML('&nbsp;')
shiny::actionButton('btn2',
                    'New Window or Tab', 
                    class = "btn-warning",
                    onclick ="window.open('http://google.com', '_blank')")
shiny::HTML('&nbsp;')
shiny::actionButton('btn3',
                    'New Window', 
                    class = "btn-success",
                    onclick ="window.open('http://google.com', '_blank','width=800,height=800')")
```
