... or rather the latter the half of 2022 since I'm getting old and can't remember the first half

## Posit 2022 Table Contest
This year I decided to participate in the Posit 2022 table contest. I was quite surprised that all 3 of my entries placed! 1 received a runner-up and the other two both received honorable mentions! 🙏   

Overall, it was a rewarding experience because it was a natural outlet to experiment with new tech (Quarto, R packages) while finally putting to work some of the [CSS/JS/HTML stuff I learned](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers) earlier in the year into something meaningful. ⚡

You can read the Posit announcement article here:

## Work
While most of what could be covered in this section is already covered in my official review of 2022 @ work 🙈, I still want to 💬 about my working or professional life this year.

I work in a global organization. The majority of my team is spread throughout the 🌍. In spite of this, 2022 was a year where I felt we connected more closely than ever. I just want to say I'm super fortunate to work with my team and have their unrelenting support and encouragement. 🤜 🤛 You would think that working globally could feel lonesome or isolating, but it feels like anything but that. 👊

It's strange - I re-joined this company during the pandemic and have been remote/hybrid since. I've yet to meet a lot of my colleagues in Germany, but I can tell you I feel as if I "know" them already.. for a while at that. I had a similar experience earlier this year where I was able to meet my US colleagues for the first time after working ~2ish years together. Strange, but familiar :) I hope 2023 allows me to meet more in person, including those in India! ✈️✈️✈️

A last note about the leadership + mgmt of my immediate and extended teams. I've never felt more empowered to do what it is I need to. I feel fully supported and trusted. ...Let that sink in for a second. I couldn't think of a better metric or litmus test to gauge an approach to leadership. I'm truly grateful. 🙏

So long, 2022 🍻!
