... or rather the latter the half of 2022 since I'm getting old and can't remember the first half

## Posit 2022 Table Contest
This year I decided to participate in the Posit 2022 table contest. I was quite surprised that all 3 of my entries placed! 1 received a runner-up and the other two both received honorable mentions! 🙏   

Overall, it was a rewarding experience because it was a natural outlet to experiment with new tech (Quarto, R packages) while finally putting to work some of the [CSS/JS/HTML stuff I learned](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers) earlier in the year into something meaningful. ⚡

You can read the Posit announcement article here:

## Work
I want to briefly 💬 about my working or professional life this year.

The majority of my team is spread throughout the 🌍. In spite of this, 2022 was a year where we connected more closely than ever. I just want to say I'm super fortunate to work with my team and have their unrelenting support and encouragement. This also goes for the leadership teams that orbit my immediate and adjacent functions. I've never felt more empowered in a position knowing I having the trust and backing of management in my proverbial corner 🤜🤛. All things considered, I'm truly grateful to have such an amazing opportunity at Bayer. 🙏 


So long, 2022 🍻!
