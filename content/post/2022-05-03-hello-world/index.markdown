Welcome to my new... blog?

This was a long time coming. My [previous portfolio](https://matt-kumar.shinyapps.io/portfolio) was getting cumbersome to maintain. I have no idea why I structured it as a shiny app. Whoopsies.  

Anyway, if you're reading this, this is my new digital home. I plan to share my thoughts and some of my work here going forward. I've started to back-port some of the previous stuff I've worked in and plan to add newer content here in the future.

If you're into R, Shiny, or statistics I think you'll enjoy this place. I hope you stick around!

A special shoutout to Andreas Handel's [guide](https://www.andreashandel.com/posts/blogdown-website-1/) for getting started with blogdown and Hugo.
