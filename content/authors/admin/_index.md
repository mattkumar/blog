I'm currently a Senior Computational Scientist with over 10 years experience in statistical methods, programming and data visualization across multiple industries. My main weapons of choice are R, Shiny, git, SAS and SQL for descriptive and inferential analyses, creating custom reports or dashboard solutions and building interactive web applications.

My formal education includes an MSc.in Biostatistics from the University of Toronto and a Honor's B.A. in Psychology from York University. I have taken a number of courses and workshops related to advanced analytics, software development and computing. I am a strong proponent of continuing education, self-learning and early adoption & experimentation. My current pursuits are expanding my Javascript, jQuery and CSS skills to enhance my web development endeavors.

I currently live in Toronto, Ontario with my loving wife and mini labradoodle.
