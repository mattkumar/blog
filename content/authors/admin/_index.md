I'm currently a Associate Director, Lead Computational Scientist with over 10 years experience in statistical methods, programming and data visualization across multiple industries. My main weapons of choice are R, Shiny, git, and python for descriptive and inferential analyses, creating custom reports or dashboard solutions and building interactive web applications.

My formal education includes an MSc.in Biostatistics from the University of Toronto and a Honor's B.A. in Psychology from York University. I have taken a number of courses and workshops related to advanced analytics, software development and computing. I am a strong proponent of continuing education, self-learning and early adoption & experimentation. My current pursuits are learning cloud technologies such as Azure, and building robust applications around large language models (LLMs).

I currently live in Toronto, Ontario with my loving wife and mini labradoodle.
