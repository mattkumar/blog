abstract: An interactive presentation I designed and delivered to our Statistical Analyst team. Using a combination of the `tidyverse` and `flipbookr` packages, I walk through R code for common data wrangling tasks step-by-step. This presentation was geared towards SAS programmers looking to explore and incorporate R into their work.
